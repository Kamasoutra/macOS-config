# macOS-config

This script allows me to install everything I need when setting up a new Mac. Fork it, edit it in any way you want !

## Basic installation

**Via curl**

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kamasoutra/macOS-config/master/config.sh)"
```

## Custom installation

**Use your own credentials**

Make your own version of the "macOS-config-variables.example" file to include your own credentials. Then edit the "CONFIG_FILE" variable in the config.sh script to your very own personal path.

⚠️ Storing real credentials in a file is not safe at all, use at your own risks ⚠️
